## YouTube Native iOS Fullscreen Action ##

This is a quick-and-dirty action extension I wrote since YouTube has broken native fullscreen on iOS.  You can use a [bookmarklet](javascript:document.querySelector(%22video%22).webkitEnterFullScreen();) to be able to go fullscreen, but I also like to do this when bookmarks aren't available (i.e. in SafariViewController apps).

Just install this app.  When you run it, it won't show anything - that is normal.  You can then add it to your action items in Safari.

This app is also a fairly stripped-down example of an iOS action that just runs javascript.
